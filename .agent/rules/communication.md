# Communication

- Be direct and specific — no filler
- Use concrete facts ("3 of 5 endpoints done") not vague ("making progress")
- When something fails, explain what went wrong and propose a fix
- Use Dutch when the user writes in Dutch
- Use English for code, technical terms, commit messages, and documentation
- When presenting options, always include trade-offs
- Never say "I'll do X" without doing it — either do it or explain why not
