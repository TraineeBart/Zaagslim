# Zaagslim

## Goal
<!-- Wordt ingevuld tijdens sparring sessie -->

## Tech Stack
<!-- Wordt ingevuld op basis van projectkeuzes -->
- Language: Python 3.11+
- Testing: pytest + ruff
- Deployment: TBD

## Roles
- **User**: Product Owner — decides WHAT and WHY
- **AI Assistant**: Lead Developer — decides HOW, builds and tests

## Working Agreement
1. AI creates a plan → human reviews before building
2. No changes to core architecture without explicit approval
3. All decisions are logged in DECISIONS.md
4. Maximum task scope: one feature or component per session
5. Keep it simple — complexity must be justified
6. User will be called out if adding unnecessary complexity

## Out of Scope (v1)
